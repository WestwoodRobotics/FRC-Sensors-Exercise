# FRC Sensor Exercise Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the FRC Sensor Exercise Repository! This repository is designed to help new students learn how to work with various sensors using WPILib. The sensors covered in this repository include IMUs, Encoders, Limit Switches, Beam Breaks, and Distance Sensors.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).
3. Explore the `src/main/java/frc/robot/sensors` directory to find the sensor implementation files.
4. Each sensor file contains TODOs and necessary imports to guide you through the implementation process.

## Sensors

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)

The IMU sensor provides information about the robot's orientation and angular velocity. It is commonly used for tasks such as balancing and navigation.

### Encoder

Encoders are used to measure the rotational position and speed of a motor shaft. They are essential for precise control of motor movements.

### Limit Switch

Limit switches are used to detect the presence or absence of an object. They are often used for safety and position detection in robotic mechanisms.

### Beam Break

Beam break sensors detect the interruption of a light beam. They are commonly used for object detection and counting applications.

### Distance Sensor

Distance sensors measure the distance between the sensor and an object. They are useful for obstacle detection and navigation.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have any improvements or new sensor implementations, feel free to open a pull request.
